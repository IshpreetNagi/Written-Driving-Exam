# Written Driving Exam
 This project is an imitation of the interface used by most Ontario government-operated centers to take the G1 knowledge exam of the average person. This specific program was created to mimic the type of interface used at the DriveTest centers located in Brampton, ON. The program is a cumulation of all the techniques and skills I have mastered within C++. Creating an imitation of the way the actual G1 exam is taken, is a way for me to put together all that I have learned and create something a project that can actually be used by people. This code incorporates things such as file systems, for-loops, pointers, references, functions, while-true loops, arrays, etc.

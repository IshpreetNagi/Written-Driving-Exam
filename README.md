# Written Driving Exam
 This project is an imitation of the interface used by most Ontario government-operated centers to take the G1 knowledge exam of the average person. This specific program was created to mimic the type of interface used at the DriveTest centers specifically located in Brampton, ON. During the creation of this code, some of the techniques I was able to learn were methods on randomizing outputs from a text file, pointers, and outputting values into a vector array from a text file. 

 # Requirements
- [C++ >= 11](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/)

# Setting Up
Once you have cloned this project on to your local machine, you can simply just run the code and see the program for what it is. 

# Future Potential
This program has the potential of being used as a way to practice for the actual G1 driving exam, or even going as far as to being upgraded with some more security features and being used as an actual G1 Knowledge exam. I went further and made it so the code is not just the exam itself, but has a couple of extra features that really add to the program as a whole. More on the extra features later, first let's talk about the exam itself.

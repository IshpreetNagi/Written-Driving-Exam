# Written Driving Exam
 This project is an imitation of the interface used by most Ontario government-operated centers to take the G1 knowledge exam of the average person. This specific program was created to mimic the type of interface used at the DriveTest centers specifically located in Brampton, ON. This program is a cumulation of my mastery of the techniques and skills within the programming language of C++. It incorporates things such as file systems, for-loops, pointers, references, functions, while-true loops, arrays, etc.

### Pre-requisites
- C++ >= 11

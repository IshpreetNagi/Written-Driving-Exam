# Written Driving Exam
 This project is an imitation of the interface used by most Ontario government-operated centers to take the G1 knowledge exam of the average person. This specific program was created to mimic the type of interface used at the DriveTest centers specifically located in Brampton, ON. During the creation of this code, some of the techniques I was able to learn were methods on randomizing outputs from a text file, pointers, and outputting values into a vector array from a text file.

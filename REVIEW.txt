| Be physically and mentally alert |

You must be in good physical and mental condition to drive. Don't drive when you are sick
or injured or when you have been drinking alcohol or taking any drug or medication
that may reduce your ability to drive.

Don't drive when you are tired. You might fall asleep at the wheel, risking the lives of
others on the road. Even if you don't fall asleep, fatigue affects your driving ability.
Your thinking slows down and you miss seeing things. In an emergency, you may
make the wrong decision or you may not make the right decision fast enough.

Don't drive when you are upset or angry. Strong emotions can
reduce your ability to think and react quickly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Get into position |

Make sure you sit properly behind the wheel. You should sit high enough in the driver’s
seat to see over the steering wheel and hood. You should be able to see the
ground four metres in front of the vehicle. Use a firm cushion if needed.

Be sure that you are sitting straight upright in the seat with your elbows slightly bent.
Adjust the seat so your feet reach the pedals easily. To check your position, try placing
your feet flat on the floor under the brake pedal. If you can do this without stretching,
you are seated properly. This keeps you in the proper, upright sitting position
and gives you more stability when manoeuvring your vehicle.

If your vehicle has an adjustable headrest, you should make sure it is at the right height.
The back of your head should be directly in front of the middle of the headrest to
protect you in a collision.

Check that you have enough room in the front seat to drive properly and safely. Do not
overcrowd your driving space with passengers or property.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Find your blind spots |

Check and adjust your mirrors and find your blind spots, the area on each side of your
vehicle where you cannot see. You may not see people or cyclists when they are in these
spots. On some vehicles the blind spot is so large that a vehicle could be there and you
would not see it.

Adjust your mirrors so that there are as few blind spots as possible. Blind spots in most
vehicles are to the back left and back right of the vehicle. To reduce the blind spots
even more, position the interior mirror so that the centre of the mirror shows the centre
of the rear window. You should be able to see directly behind the car when the interior
mirror is properly adjusted. Position the left outside mirror by leaning towards the window
and moving the mirror so that you can just see the rear of your car. Position the
right outside mirror by leaning to the centre of the vehicle and moving the mirror so that
you can again just see the rear of your car. Avoid overlap in what you can see in your
mirrors. Because your side mirrors show only narrow angles of view, turning your head to
do shoulder checks is the only way to make sure there is nothing in your blind spots.

You should know the blind spots on your own vehicle. You can learn where and how large
they are by having someone walk around your car and watching the person in the mirrors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Child safety |

To be safely protected in a vehicle, children must be properly secured in a child car seat,
booster seat or seatbelt, depending on their height, weight and/or age. Research shows that
a correctly used child car seat can reduce the likelihood of injury or death by 75 per cent.

As a driver, you are responsible for ensuring that all passengers under 16 years of age are
properly buckled into a seatbelt, child car seat or booster seat. In Ontario, all drivers must
use proper child car seats and booster seats when transporting young children.

Child car seats must meet Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Buckles and straps must be
fastened according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Newer vehicles that come equipped with
a lower universal anchorage system (UAS) for securing a child car seat do not require the use
of a seatbelt. A booster seat requires a lap and shoulder belt combination.

Infants who weigh less than 9 kilograms (20 lbs.) must be buckled into a rear-facing child
car seat attached to the vehicle by a seatbelt or the UAS strap. A rear-facing child car seat
is always best installed in the back seat. Never put a rear-facing child car seat in a seating
position that has an active airbag. If the airbag inflates, it could seriously injure the child.

Toddlers 9 to 18 kilograms (20 to 40 lbs.) must be buckled into a child car seat attached to
the vehicle by a seatbelt or a UAS strap; the seat’s tether strap must also be attached to the
vehicle’s tether anchor. Children weighing more than 9 kilograms (20 lbs.) may remain in a
rear-facing child car seat if it is designed to accommodate the child’s height and weight.
Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions when installing a child car seat in your vehicle.

Booster seats provide 60 per cent more protection than seatbelts alone. These must be used by
pre-school and primary-grade-aged children who have outgrown their forward-facing child car seat,
are under the age of eight and weigh 18 kilograms (40 lbs.) or more but less than
36 kilograms (80 lbs.), and who are less than 145 centimetres (4 feet, 9 inches) tall.
Booster seats raise a child so that the adult seatbelt works more effectively. The child’s head
must be supported by the top of the booster, vehicle seat or headrest. You must use a booster
seat with a lap/shoulder belt. The lap/shoulder belt should be worn so that the shoulder belt
fits closely against the body, over the shoulder and across the centre of the chest and the lap
belt sits firmly against the body and across the hips. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions
when installing a booster seat in your vehicle, and secure the booster seat with a seatbelt when
a child is not travelling in it, or remove it from the vehicle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Use of turn signals and brake lights |

Signals tell other drivers what you want to do, alerting them to your intention to turn or stop.

Use your turn signals and brake lights to signal before stopping, slowing down, turning,
changing lanes, leaving the road or moving out from a parked position. Give the correct
signal well before taking the action and make sure other drivers can see it. Check that the
way is clear before you act, just signalling is not enough. Follow the rules for turns,
whether left or right, on lane changes and on yields to other vehicles and pedestrians.

If your turn signals and brake lights are not working, use hand and arm signals.
When watching for signals made by others, remember that cyclists may signal right turns
by holding their right arms straight out.

After signalling, move only when it is safe to do so.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Keep right |

Keep to the right of the road or in the right-hand lane on multi-lane roads unless you
want to turn left or pass another vehicle. This is especially important if you are
driving more slowly than other vehicles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Obey speed limits |

Obey the maximum speed limit posted on signs along the road, but always drive at a speed
that will let you stop safely. This means driving below the maximum speed in bad weather,
in heavy traffic or in construction zones. School zones and construction zones often
have lower speed limits to protect children and those who work on or near the road.

Where there are no posted speed limits, the maximum speed is 50 km/h in cities,
towns and villages, and 80 km/h elsewhere.

Cruise control is a driver aid that can improve fuel economy and prevent you from
inadvertently exceeding the speed limit. However, there are some circumstances in
which cruise control should not be used, such as adverse
driving conditions (wet, icy or slippery roads), in heavy traffic or when
you are feeling fatigued.

Speed measuring warning devices are illegal. If you get caught driving with such
a device, you will be fined and accumulate demerit points.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Obey police |

When police officers are directing traffic, you must follow their directions,
even if the directions are different from traffic lights or signs.

When a police officer signals you to pull your vehicle over, you must pull
over as far to the right as you safely can and come to a complete stop. Stay in
your vehicle and wait for the police officer. You must immediately, upon the
police officer’s request, surrender your driver’s licence, vehicle permit (or copy)
and insurance. Contrary to popular belief, you do not have 24 hours to present
these documents. If you do not obey a police officer’s direction to pull over,
you risk being fined, having your licence suspended or even serving time in prison.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Maintaining space |

As a general rule, drive at the same speed as traffic around you without going
over the speed limit. Leave a cushion of space around your vehicle to let other
drivers see you and to avoid a collision.

Whenever you follow another vehicle, you need enough space to stop safely if
the other vehicle brakes suddenly. A safe following distance is at least two
seconds behind the vehicle in front of you. This lets you see around the
vehicle ahead and gives you enough distance to stop suddenly.

To give yourself a two-second space, follow these steps:

1. Pick a marker on the road ahead, such as a road sign or telephone pole.
2. When the rear of the vehicle ahead passes the marker, count
"one thousand and one, one thousand and two".
3. When the front of your vehicle reaches the marker, stop counting.
If you reach the marker before you count "one thousand and two," you are
following too closely.

Remember that the two-second rule gives a minimum following distance.
It applies only to ideal driving conditions. You will need extra space
in certain situations, such as bad weather, when following motorcycles or
large trucks, or when carrying a heavy load.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Sharing the road with cyclists |

Bicycles and mopeds travelling at a lower speed than other traffic are expected to
ride about one metre from the curb or parked cars, or as close as practical to the
right-hand edge of the road when there is no curb. However, they can use any part
of the lane if necessary for safety, such as to:

- Avoid obstacles such as puddles, ice, sand, debris, rutted or grooved pavement,
potholes and sewer grates
- Cross railway or streetcar tracks at a 90° angle
- Discourage passing where the lane is too narrow to be shared safely
-A bike lane may exist adjacent to parking bays

Cyclists are not required to ride close to the right edge of the road when they are
travelling at or faster than the normal speed of traffic at that time and place, or
when they are turning left, or getting in position to turn left.
(Cyclists are permitted to make a left turn from a left-turn lane, where one
is available.)

When passing a cyclist, drivers of motor vehicles must maintain a minimum
distance of one metre, where practical between their vehicle and the cyclist.
Failure to do so may result in a fine and an additional two demerit points
on the driver’s record. Whenever possible, you should change lanes to pass.

Do not follow too closely behind cyclists. They do not have brake lights to warn
you when they are slowing or stopping.

Do not sound your horn unnecessarily when you are overtaking a cyclist.
It may frighten them and cause them to lose control. If you feel that you
must use your horn, tap it quickly and lightly while you are still some
distance away from the cyclist.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Controlled intersections |

Controlled intersections have traffic lights, yield signs or stop signs to
control traffic.

At a controlled intersection where you face a green light, drive carefully
through the intersection at a steady speed. If the light has been green
for a while, be prepared to stop when it turns yellow. However, if you are
already so close that you cannot stop safely, drive through the intersection
with caution. Where you face a red light, come to a complete stop and wait
until the light turns green.

When you approach an intersection on a main road, and the intersection is
blocked with traffic, stop before entering the intersection and wait until
the traffic ahead moves on. This does not apply if you are turning left or
right.

At a controlled intersection where you face a yield sign, slow down or stop
if necessary and wait until the way is clear before driving through the
intersection.

At a controlled intersection where you face a stop sign, come to a complete stop.
Drive through the intersection only when the way is clear.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Uncontrolled intersections |

Uncontrolled intersections have no signs or traffic lights. They are usually found
in areas where there is not much traffic. Be extra careful around these
intersections. If two vehicles come to an uncontrolled intersection from different
roads at the same time, the driver on the left must let the driver on the
right go first. This is called yielding the right-of-way.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Yielding the right-of-way |

There are times when you must yield the right-of-way. This means you must let another
driver go first. Here are some rules about when you must yield the right-of-way.

At an intersection without signs or lights, you must yield the right-of-way to a vehicle
approaching the intersection before you, and if you arrive at the same time,
the vehicle approaching from the right has the right-of-way.

At an intersection with stop signs at all corners, you must yield the right-of-way to the
first vehicle to come to a complete stop. If two vehicles stop at the same time, the
vehicle on the left must yield to the vehicle on the right.

At any intersection where you want to turn left or right, you must yield the right-of-way.
If you are turning left, you must wait for approaching traffic to pass or turn and for
pedestrians in or approaching your path to cross. If you are turning right, you must wait
for pedestrians to cross if they are in or approaching your path (Diagram 2-20). You
should also check your blind spot for cyclists approaching from behind, particularly in
a bike lane to your right, on a sidewalk or a trail. A yield sign means you must slow
down or stop if necessary and yield the right-of-way to traffic in the intersection or
on the intersecting road.

When entering a road from a private road or driveway, you must yield to vehicles on the
road and pedestrians on the sidewalk.

You must yield the right-of-way and wait for pedestrians to completely cross the road at
pedestrian crossovers and school crossings with crossing guards.

Remember, signalling does not give you the right-of-way.
You must make sure the way is clear.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Stopping |

Knowing how to stop safely and properly is an important driving skill. Safe and responsible
drivers see stops ahead, check their mirrors, begin braking early and stop smoothly.
Braking is easier when you sit properly. Use your right foot for both brake and gas
pedals so you won't step on both pedals at the same time or activate your brake lights
unnecessarily. Press the brake pedal firmly and evenly.

In a vehicle with manual transmission, try shifting into a lower gear going down long,
steep hills. This will help control your speed and you won't have to brake as sharply.
Downshift before starting downhill since it may not be possible once you are going downhill.
As a guide, you should be in the same gear going downhill as uphill.

You must come to a complete stop for all stop signs and red traffic lights.
Stop at the stop line if it is marked on the pavement.

If there is no stop line, stop at the crosswalk, marked or not. If there is no crosswalk,
stop at the edge of the sidewalk. If there is no sidewalk, stop at the edge of the
intersection. Wait until the way is clear before entering the intersection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Turning a corner |

To turn a corner, signal well before the turn. When the way is clear, move into the proper lane,
either the far right lane for a right turn or the far left lane in your direction for a left
turn. Signal your turn and look from side to side and check your blind spots to make sure the
way is clear.

Slow down before you enter the turn; the sharper the turn, the slower you should go. To keep
full control of the vehicle, finish braking before you turn the steering wheel.

For a sharp turn, turn the steering wheel with one hand and cross the other hand over it. Grip
the wheel on the other side and continue turning. This is called “hand over hand steering.” When
you have completed the turn, relax your grip on the steering wheel and let it slip or gently
feed it through your hands to return to the straight-ahead position. Do not turn the steering
wheel with one finger or the flat palm of your hand. Gradually increase speed as you complete
the turn.

Remember, drivers often lose control of vehicles and skid because they try to do more
than one thing at a time. Try not to brake and steer at the same time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Right turns |

Unless signs or pavement markings tell you not to, always begin and end a right turn
close to the right side of the road.

To make a right turn, signal well before the turn and move into the right-hand lane when
the way is clear. If the right-hand lane is not marked, keep as far to the right of the
road as possible. Look ahead, left, right and left again before starting to turn. If
you have not seen any smaller vehicles or pedestrians, check your right rear blind spot.
Let cyclists, limited-speed motorcycles, or moped riders go through the intersection
before you turn. When it is safe, complete your turn into the right-hand lane of the
road you are entering.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Left turns |

Unless signs or pavement markings tell you not to, always begin and end a left turn
in the far left lane in your direction.

To make a left turn, signal well before the turn and move into the far left lane when
the way is clear. Look ahead, behind, left, right and left again and check your blind
spots. Make your turn when the way is clear.

When you are stopped at an intersection waiting for approaching traffic to clear,
don't turn your steering wheel to the left until you can complete the turn. With
your wheels turned to the left, your vehicle could be pushed into the path of
oncoming traffic.

When two vehicles coming from opposite directions meet in an intersection waiting
to turn left, each should turn to the left of the other after yielding the right-of-way
to pedestrians and oncoming traffic.

Motorcycles, bicycles, limited-speed motorcycles and mopeds turn left at intersections
in the same way as larger vehicles. If you are making a left turn behind one of these
vehicles, do not pull up beside it to make your turn at the same time. Stay behind
and turn when the way is clear. Wait for the smaller vehicle to move right before
you pass.

Turn from the lane closest to the centre line to the lane right of the centre line,
following a smooth arc. Then, when you can, move into the right curb lane.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Passing |

Passing is changing lanes to move past a slower vehicle. While all public roads have
speed limits, not all vehicles travel at the same speed. For example, cyclists,
road service vehicles and drivers ahead that are preparing to turn are usually
slower than the through traffic. You may want to pass some slow-moving vehicles
when you are following them.

Never overtake and pass another vehicle unless you are sure you can do so without
danger to yourself or others. Don't pass moving snow plows under any conditions.
If in doubt, do not pass.

Here are the steps for passing a vehicle:

1. Use your left-turn signal to show that you want to pass and check that the
way is clear ahead and behind before moving into the passing lane.
2. Watch for bicycles and small vehicles that may be hidden from view in
front of the vehicle you are about to pass. Also watch for vehicles that
may be turning left in front of you and vehicles or pedestrians entering the
road from another road or driveway.
3. Change lanes only after signalling. After overtaking, signal that you want
to move back into the lane you started from, and when you can see the entire
front of the vehicle you are passing in your inside mirror, make the lane
change. Be careful not to cut off a vehicle by suddenly moving in front of it.
4. If the vehicle you are passing speeds up, do not race. Go back to your original
lane. And do not speed up when another driver is trying to pass you. It is
unlawful and dangerous.

Passing within 30 metres of a pedestrian crossover is not permitted. Passing left
of a centreline is not permitted 30 metres from a bridge, viaduct or tunnel.
Don't attempt to pass when approaching the crest of a hill or on a curve where
your vision of oncoming traffic is obstructed and there is not enough clear distance
ahead to pass in safety.

When passing parked vehicles, watch carefully for people suddenly opening doors
or for doors opened to load and unload.

Motorcycles, bicycles, limited-speed motorcycles and mopeds often need to pull
to the left or right side of their lane to avoid dangerous road conditions or to
be seen by other drivers. Do not take this as an invitation to pass in the same
lane. If you do want to pass these vehicles, do so by changing lanes.

When faster traffic wants to pass you, move to the right and let it pass in safety.
When being passed on an undivided road where the passing driver has pulled into
the opposite lane, pay attention to oncoming traffic and move closer to the right
side of the lane. Be prepared to slow down to let the passing driver get in front
of you more quickly to prevent a collision.

On many high-speed roads with three or more lanes in each direction, trucks are
not allowed to drive in the far left-hand lane. This means that the lane next
to it is the truck passing lane. If you are in this lane and a truck wants to pass,
move into the right-hand lane as soon as you can.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Parking along roadways |

Since parking rules change from road to road and place to place, always watch for
and obey signs that say you may not stop or limit stopping, standing or parking.
Be aware that not all parking by-laws are posted on signs.

Here are some basic parking rules:

1. Never park on the travelled part of a road. Drive off the road onto the
shoulder if you must stop for some reason.
2. Never park on a curve, hill or anywhere you do not have a clear view for
at least 125 metres in both directions.
3. Do not park where you will block a vehicle already parked or where you will
block a sidewalk, crosswalk, pedestrian crossing or road entrance.
4. Do not park within three metres of a fire hydrant, on or within 100 metres
of a bridge or within six metres of a public entrance to a hotel, theatre or
public hall when it is open to the public.
5. Do not park within nine metres of an intersection or within 15 metres if
it is controlled by traffic lights.
6. Do not park within 15 metres of the nearest rail of a level railway crossing.
7. Do not park where you will get in the way of traffic or snow clearing.
8. Never open the door of your parked vehicle without first making sure
that you will not endanger any other person or vehicle or interfere with
traffic. Generally, a good practice is to open the driver’s door with your
right hand as this will force a shoulder check at the same time. Take extra
precautions to avoid opening a door in the path of cyclists, who often ride
close to parked cars (Diagram 2-50). When you must open a door next to traffic,
keep it open only long enough to load or unload passengers.

After parking your vehicle, always turn off the ignition and the lights,
remove the key and lock the door to deter theft. Do not leave children or
animals in the vehicle.

Before moving from a parked position, always signal and check for traffic,
pulling out only when it is safe to do so.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Cell phones |

Drivers using hand-held cell phones face fines, suspension and other penalties.

Even if your vehicle has driver-assistance features, you can be charged
with distracted, careless or dangerous driving. You are still expected to be
in care and control of your vehicle, which means you must be constantly
monitoring your environment and able to take over immediate control of
the vehicle.

Make it a habit to pull over and park to use your cell phone, or have a
passenger take the call or let it go to voice mail. If you really need to
use a cell phone when driving, you must use it hands-free.

Police can charge drivers with careless driving or even dangerous driving
(a criminal offence) if they do not pay full attention to the driving task.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Emergency vehicles |

Emergency vehicles – police, fire, ambulance and special public-utility
vehicles – are easily identified through their use of flashing red or blue
lights, a siren or bell, or alternating flashes of white light from their
headlamp high beams. Also, be aware that police, fire and ambulance services
use many different types of vehicles, such as bicycles, snowmobiles,
all-terrain vehicles, motorcycles, buses and trucks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Reacting to an approaching emergency vehicle |

When an emergency vehicle is approaching your vehicle from any direction
with its flashing red or red and blue lights, or siren or bell sounding, you
are required to bring your vehicle to an immediate stop.

When bringing your vehicle to a stop, you are required to bring your
vehicle as near as is practical to the right-hand curb or edge of the
roadway. When on a one-way road or divided highway having more than two
lanes of traffic, move to the closest curb or edge of the roadway. Your
vehicle should be parallel to the roadway and clear of any intersections,
including highway on/off ramps. Do not move onto or stop on the shoulder of
the roadway, as emergency vehicles may be travelling along it.

Use extreme caution when stopping your vehicle because other drivers may not
yet be aware of or are already reacting to the approaching emergency vehicle.
Look to the front, both sides and toward the rear of your vehicle, signal your
intention to pull over well in advance and begin to adjust your vehicle's speed
to merge with any traffic to the side you are pulling to. Once you have moved
your vehicle to the side, brake gradually as required and bring your vehicle to
a safe stop. Avoid any sudden changes in direction or excessive braking and be
aware of any vehicles approaching fast to the rear of your vehicle.

If you are in an intersection and preparing to make a turn when an emergency
vehicle is approaching, you should abandon the turn and clear the intersection
by proceeding straight when safe to do so, then pull to the right and stop. This
will clear the intersection and minimize the possibility of a collision with the
emergency vehicle should it be passing you on the side you intended to turn towards.

When the emergency vehicle has passed, check to make sure the way is clear and
signal before merging back into traffic. Remain vigilant for additional emergency
vehicles, and remember it is illegal to follow within 150 metres of a fire vehicle
responding to an alarm.

Note: Some firefighters and volunteer medical responders may display a flashing
green light when using their own vehicles to respond to a fire or medical emergency.
Please yield the right-of-way to help them respond to an emergency call quickly and
safely.

Police or other enforcement officers may require you to pull over and bring your
vehicle to an immediate stop. Typically, the officer may signal this requirement by
driving their vehicle with its emergency lights flashing and/or siren on behind your
vehicle or by using hand gestures from the side of the road. When stopping your vehicle,
follow the previous procedures, except that you should bring your vehicle to a stop
outside of traffic lanes and onto the shoulder of the roadway where possible, or turn
and stop on a side street with less traffic if in the immediate vicinity. If the
officer gives direction as to where to stop, follow the officer's directions.

Stay alert

When you see an approaching emergency vehicle with its lights or siren on,
prepare to clear the way.

- React quickly but calmly. Don't slam on the brakes or pull over suddenly.
Use your signals to alert other drivers you intend to pull over.
- Check your rearview mirrors. Look in front and on both sides of your vehicle.
Allow other vehicles to also pull over. Pull to the right and gradually come to
a stop.
- Wait for the emergency vehicle to pass and watch for other emergency vehicles that
may be responding to the same call. Check to make sure the way is clear and signal
before merging back into traffic.
- Don't drive on or block the shoulder on freeways. Emergency vehicles will use the
shoulder of the road if all lanes are blocked.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Failing to respond to an emergency vehicle |

Take emergency flashing lights and sirens seriously. Proceed with caution,
clear the way and bring your vehicle to a stop, where required. It's the law.
If you don’t stop, you can be fined and get three demerit points for a first
offence. For additional offences, fines increase and you could also go to jail
for up to six months.

Please note the above law, fines and penalties are also applicable to a tow truck
with its lamp producing intermittent flashes of amber light that is stopped on a
highway.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Skids |

A skid may happen when one or more tires lose their grip with the road’s surface.
Skids most often happen on a slippery surface, such as a road that is wet, icy or
covered with snow, gravel or some other loose material. Most skids result from
driving too fast for road conditions. Hard braking and overly aggressive turning
or accelerating can cause your vehicle to skid and possibly go out of control.

To avoid a skid on a slippery road, drive at a reduced speed and operate the
vehicle’s controls in a smooth and constrained manner. Increasing tire forces,
such as by braking or accelerating while steering may push tires even closer to
a skid condition. It’s essential that the vehicle’s speed be maintained at a safe
level and that turns be made gently.

If your vehicle begins to skid, try not to panic - it is possible to maintain
control of your vehicle, even in a skid. Ease off on the accelerator or brake and
on a very slippery surface slip the transmission into neutral if you can. Continue
to steer in the direction you wish to go. Be careful not to oversteer. Once you
regain control, you can brake as needed, but very gently and smoothly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Snow |

Snow may be hard-packed and slippery as ice; rutted, full of hard tracks and gullies;
or smooth and soft. Look ahead and anticipate what you must do based on the conditions.
Slow down on rutted, snowy roads. Avoid sudden steering, braking or accelerating that
could cause a skid. Do not use cruise control during times of snow and other inclement
weather.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Ice |

As temperatures drop below freezing, wet roads become icy. Sections of road in shaded
areas or on bridges and overpasses freeze first. It is important to look ahead, slow
down and anticipate ice. If the road ahead looks like black and shiny asphalt, be suspicious.
It may be covered by a thin layer of ice known as black ice. Generally, asphalt in the
winter should look gray-white in colour. If you think there may be black ice ahead,
slow down and be careful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Snow plows |

Snow-removal vehicles on public roadways are equipped with flashing blue lights that
can be seen from 150 metres.

Flashing blue lights warn you of wide and slow-moving vehicles: some snow plows
have a wing that extends as far as three metres to the right of the vehicle. On
freeways, several snow plows may be staggered across the road, clearing all lanes
at the same time by passing a ridge of snow from plow to plow. Do not try to pass
between them. This is extremely dangerous because there is not enough room to pass
safely, and the ridge of wet snow can throw your vehicle out of control.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| If a tire blows out |

Blowouts can cause tremendous steering and wheel vibration, but don't be alarmed.
Take your foot off the gas pedal to slow down and steer the vehicle firmly in the
direction you want to go. Bring the vehicle to a stop off the road.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| If your wheels go off the pavement |

Don't panic. Grip the steering wheel firmly. Take your foot off the gas pedal to
slow down. Avoid heavy braking. When the vehicle is under control, steer toward
the pavement. Be prepared to correct your steering and increase speed when your
wheels are fully back on the pavement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| If your headlights go out |

Check the switch immediately. If the lights stay out, turn on your hazard lights and
bring your vehicle to a safe stop off the road. Call for help. It is dangerous and
illegal to drive at night without lights.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| If your brakes fail |

Try pumping the brake pedal to temporarily restore hydraulic brake pressure.
If this does not work, apply the parking brake gently but firmly while holding the
release button. It is a good idea for new drivers to practice a parking-brake emergency
stop under controlled conditions with a qualified driving instructor. Total brake
failure is very rare on modern vehicles. If your brakes do fail and you manage to stop,
do not drive away. Call for help.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| If your gas pedal sticks |

First try to lift the pedal by slipping your foot under it. Do not reach down with
your hands while the vehicle is moving. If this does not work, turn on your hazard
lights, shift to neutral and stop as soon as you safely can, preferably off the road.
Turn off the ignition and do not drive away. Call for help.
